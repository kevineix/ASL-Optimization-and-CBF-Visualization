# ASL Optimization and CBF Visualization
By: Kevin Xie

MATLAB Version: 9.14.0.2286388 (R2023a) Update 3

This repository contains the code and installation package for an application I designed to assist in the preparation and visualization of CBF images.

## Key Features
  - Intuitive and User-Friendly Interface
  - Streamlined Data Preparation Process
  - Interactive Masking for Accurate CBF Visualization
  - Comprehensive Display Options

### Toolbox
  - The functions used within the app can be found in ‘toolbox’
  - Optimizes ASL_Preparation and ASL_CBF functions
  - Utilizes spm8 library

## Getting Started
### [Installing](https://github.com/kevineix/ASL-Optimization-and-CBF-Visualization/tree/main/Install) the App

To install the app, click [here](https://github.com/kevineix/ASL-Optimization-and-CBF-Visualization/blob/main/App_Installer.mlappinstall) and then click on "AppInstaller.mlappinstall." When prompted, click "Install."

### Download Necessary [Functions](https://github.com/kevineix/ASL-Optimization-and-CBF-Visualization/tree/main/toolbox)
After you have downloaded the application into MATLAB, you will need to download several functions to go along with it.

Download every file located inside ["toolbox."](https://github.com/kevineix/ASL-Optimization-and-CBF-Visualization/tree/main/toolbox) Be sure to organize all the functions into a new folder, and then set it as the "Current Folder" on MATLAB.

### Organizing Data

If you have data, make sure to organize each scan into different folders. You may also use and [download example data.](https://github.com/kevineix/ASL-Optimization-and-CBF-Visualization/blob/main/SampleData.zip) Once you have downloaded the zip file, make sure to unzip it.

***After completing these steps, the MATLAB application will be ready for use.***
